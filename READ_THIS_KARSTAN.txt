It's Jackson, and I'm trying to access the script outline for the digital story-thing. This is the only contact means I could think of, 
sorry if you were unable to read. I don't have access on Google Docs, so if someone could share it with me so that I could finish the script, 
that would be phenomenal. Thanks!
